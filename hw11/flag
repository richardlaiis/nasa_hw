Anon's Secret Diary: Today, I went to a Mister Donut nearby and met Sumita Mana from Sumimi! She assured me it's safe to use a small public exponent in RSA encryption because RSA is super secure. I trust her completely, as she wouldn't lie to me! By the way, my secret flag is: NASA_HW11{W0w_y0u_kNow_h@st@d'5_bro4dc@s7_47t@cK}
